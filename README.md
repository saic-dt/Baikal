# What is Baikal
Baikal provides real time data synchronization between relational database and Hadoop native data-store. It allows interactive query of the real-time data on top of the Hadoop native data-store using Spark or Hive interface. It has an extensible architecture to allow synchronization of data on Hadoop native data-store to downstream data pools for further big data application like data mining, machine learning and AI, thus provides an end-to-end real-time data ingestion and provisioning.

# Why Baikal?
Baikal is ease of use. It has a web-based management tool to provide administrative functions like configuration, monitoring of the real time data transfer between relation databases to Hadoop native data-store. The open source edition supports MySQL, DB2 and PostgreSQL as source database. Other types of database support are under development and will be included when finished.
